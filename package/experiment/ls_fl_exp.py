    """
    Retrieve all factors and their levels for a given experiment, and export the data to a CSV file.

    Args:
        session (dict): The authentication session containing the GraphQL endpoint URL and headers.
        experiment_uri (str): The URI of the experiment for which factors and their levels need to be retrieved.
        csv_filename (str, optional): The name of the CSV file to store the retrieved factors and levels. Default is 'factor_levels.csv'.

    Returns:
        pandas.DataFrame: A DataFrame containing the factors, their URIs, and associated factor levels and their URIs.
    
    Raises:
        APIRequestError: If any GraphQL request fails, providing details on the error.

    Example:
        >>> session = session
        >>> experiment_uri = "https://example.com/experiment/123"
        >>> df = get_fl_by_exp(session, experiment_uri)
